LongMemEval Evaluation for Hebbian Memory

Loads encoded Hebbian memory graphs and evaluates on LongMemEval-S questions.
Uses the configured Google AI model (Gemma) as judge with type-specific prompts (same as LightMem).

Usage:
    python -m hela_mem.eval_longmemeval \
        --data_path /path/to/longmemeval_s.json \
        --mem_dir results/longmemeval_mem_XXXX \
        [--num_items 500] [--start_item 0] [--top_k 20] \
        [--use_consolidation] [--workers 10]
